# Multidimensional Scaling on MNIST Digit Dataset

This repository contains the implementation of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) on the MNIST digit dataset. The dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
## Overview
In this project ,MDS is used to project high-dimensional data into lower dimensions for visualization purposes.
